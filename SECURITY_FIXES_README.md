# üîí Security Vulnerability Fixes Applied

## Critical Security Issues Resolved

### Issue: Hardcoded JWT Tokens in Source Code
**Severity: CRITICAL** üö®

The codebase contained hardcoded Supabase service role JWT tokens in multiple files, which is a severe security vulnerability that could lead to:
- Complete database access bypass
- Unauthorized data modification
- Privilege escalation attacks
- Data breaches

### Files That Were Fixed

1. **`src/services/supabaseAdmin.js`** - Removed hardcoded service role key
2. **`src/services/admin.js`** - Fixed 2 instances of hardcoded service keys
3. **`src/services/profiles.js`** - Fixed 2 instances of hardcoded service keys  
4. **`src/services/follow.js`** - Fixed hardcoded service key in constructor
5. **`.mcp.json`** - Secured MCP server configuration
6. **`create-follows-table-mcp.js`** - Added environment variable validation
7. **`supabase-mcp-alt.sh`** - Completely secured shell script

### Security Measures Implemented

#### ‚úÖ Environment Variable Migration
- All hardcoded JWT tokens replaced with `process.env` lookups
- Added validation to ensure environment variables are set
- Graceful error handling with security warnings

#### ‚úÖ .env Template Created
- Created `.env.example` with secure configuration template
- Added clear security warnings and usage instructions
- Documented which variables are safe for client-side use

#### ‚úÖ Enhanced .gitignore
- Added comprehensive environment file exclusions
- Prevents accidental commit of sensitive credentials
- Added security-focused file patterns

#### ‚úÖ Script Hardening
- Shell scripts now validate environment variables before execution
- Clear error messages guide proper secure setup
- No more inline credential storage

### Required Setup Steps

To complete the security implementation:

1. **Create Environment File:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Add Your Actual Keys to .env:**
   ```env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://kmhmoxzhsljtnztywfre.supabase.co
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_anon_key_here
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_actual_service_key_here
   ```

3. **Set Shell Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   export SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_anon_key"
   export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_service_role_key"
   ```

### Security Best Practices Now Enforced

- ‚úÖ No hardcoded secrets in source code
- ‚úÖ Environment-based credential management
- ‚úÖ Secure defaults with validation
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of client vs server credentials
- ‚úÖ Git exclusion of sensitive files
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling

### Key Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Service Role Keys**: Only use in secure server environments or development tools. Never expose in client-side applications.

üîí **Anon Keys**: Safe for client-side use but should still be managed securely through environment variables.

üîÑ **Key Rotation**: Consider rotating all Supabase keys as they were previously exposed in source code.
